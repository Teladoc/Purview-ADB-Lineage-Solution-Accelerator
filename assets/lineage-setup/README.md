## Setup utilities for configuring lineage for Azure Synapse Analytics Spark Pool and Microsoft Purview

The utilities in this repo helps to simplify resources required for configuring Azure Synapse Spark pools to emit lineage information into Microsoft Purivew. 

## Prerequisites

This utility provisions resources in a Virtual Network with Private Endpoints. Hence the utlities must be run from a CLI enviroment which as access to the private endpoints. Typically from an on-premises VM which has network connectivity to Azure Virtual network.

* Powershell or Linux Bash CLI. If using Linux, the utility leverages several linux packages such as jq and bash scripting which needs a Linux bash CLI. The utility can run in any of the below linux bash environments. 

            macOS Terminal 
            Windows WSL 
            Linux 
            Azure Cloud Shell - Bash ( this already has az cli installed)

* git cli installed.

* Azure Virual Network and Subnet resource created to provision private endpoints.

* New Azure Resource Group created to provision Azure Resources.

* RBAC premission to provision resources in Azure, namely, Azure Synapse Workspace Administrator, Purview Administrator, Resource Group contributor.

* Service Principal with above RBAC permissions.

* Install az cli with one command

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
    ```

* Login into Azure using az cli. The credentials should have permission to provision Azure Resources.

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

* Azure Active Directory Service Principals and Secret.

* Network connectivity to Azure Virtual Network.

* Private DNS Zone Virtual Network Links needs to be created for the below DNS zones. The Virtual Network link should be created for existing VNet where the resource private endpoints would be created.

## How to run utility using bash

1. Clone repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anildwarepo/Purview-ADB-Lineage-Solution-Accelerator.git
    cd Purview-ADB-Lineage-Solution-Accelerator/assets/lineage-setup
    ```

2. Provision Azure Resources that creates the required components to capture and process spark lineage. Follow prompts for needed input parameters.

    ```bash
    ./setup-lineage-cloudshell.sh
    ```
    **Note** This utility can be run from Azure Cloud Shell without requiring network connectivity to Azure Virtual Network.

3. Assign Synapse Spark role definitions

    ```bash
    ./assign-synapse-roles-run-within-network.sh
    ```
    **Note** This utility requires network connectivity to Azure Virtual Network.
    
4. Create purivew typedefs and entities

    ```bash
    ./create-purview-typedefs-relationship-run-within-network.sh
    ```
    **Note** This utility requires network connectivity to Azure Virtual Network.
